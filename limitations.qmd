# Limitations

This extension would be much better if I understood more about how Quarto works. A Pandoc filter only gets to look at one file at a time. The AST is built, modified, and then written. That makes cross-references impossible at that level. Quarto obviously operates at a higher level where all that is orchestrated together, but it's opaque to me. Hence, my filter dumps the cross-references into files that are concatenated together in order to be read on the next full rendering.

The listings mechanism is powerful but limited in scope. All it will do is mine a directory of markdown files for metadata or take a single file of collected metadata. That makes sense for its intended use case, but it's a straitjacket for more general uses.
