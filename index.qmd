# Demo

## Description

This filter automates the creation of listings of cross-referenced items. Say you have a book project over multiple files, and it includes many formal `example` divs, such as the following.

::::{#exm-example1 description="A fine example" type=foo}
## Good example
This is example 1.
::::

There may be examples on pages throughout the book. Your readers might like to have a one-stop summary of all of them. But this is tedious and fragile for you to do by hand.

Instead, you could simply have the following.

### Table of examples

This directory of examples is updated each time the website is rendered.

:::{#Examples}
:::

## Other crossref types

The same mechanism works for definitions, theorems, and similar divs. 

:::{#def-definition title="Theorem-like divs" type=bar}
A **theorem-like div** is a cross-referenceable named block in a Quarto document, as listed in [the Quarto guide](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html#theorems-and-proofs).
:::

::::{#exm-example2 description="Pointless example" type=bar}
This is the second example. 
::::



The attributes `description` and `type` are included as columns in the table of examples, so that information appears there for this example.
