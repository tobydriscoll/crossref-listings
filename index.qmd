# Demo of crossref-listings

## Description

This filter automates the creation of listings of cross-referenced items. Say you have a book project over multiple files, and it includes many formal `example` divs, such as the following.

::::{#exm-example1 description="A fine example" type=Code}
## Good example
This is example 1.
::::

There may be examples on pages throughout the book. Your readers might like to have a one-stop summary of all of them. But this is tedious and fragile for you to do by hand.

Instead, you could simply have the following.

### Table of examples {.unnumbered}

This directory of examples is updated each time the website is rendered. Note that it includes material from the entire project, not just this page.

:::{#Examples}
:::

## Installation {#sec-install}

### Method 1 (recommended)

Install the Python packages `quarto`, `pandoc`, and `yaml`. 

To create your Quarto project, enter the following at the command line and follow the prompts:

```bash
quarto use template tobydriscoll/crossref-listings
```

If you want to add the capability to an existing project, you need the file `find_crossrefs.py` and the subdirectory `_extensions`. 

### Method 2 (no dependencies)

At the command line and in the project's root directory, enter 

```bash
quarto install extension tobydriscoll/crossref-listings
```

This has to be done for each project where you want to use the extension.
