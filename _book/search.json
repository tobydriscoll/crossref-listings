You just include the one you want in the contents metadata of listing.\n\nExample 2.2 To create the definition table below, the following was put into the metadata of this file:\nlisting:\n  - id: Definitions\n    contents: \n      - _crossrefs/def.yml\n      - _crossrefs\n    type: table\n    fields: [title, link]\nThen, at the place where the table is to appear, we put\n:::{#Definitions}\n:::\n\n\n   \n     \n     \n       Order By\n       Default\n         \n          Title\n        \n         \n          link\n        \n     \n  \n    \n      \n      \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n\n\nlink\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheorem-like divs\n\n\nDefinition 1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe inclusion of _crossrefs in the contents property above seems superfluous, but the Quarto listing mechanism seems to ignore a file of listing info unless it also has a directory to scan."
