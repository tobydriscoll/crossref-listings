# Usage

This filter is intended for Quarto book projects, though it could be used in any website project. 

The main catch is that (like LaTeX) the included tabulated information is based on the *previous* rendering, not the current one. 

::: {.callout-important}
You must render the entire project twice in order to get a complete update.
:::

If you use Quarto in preview mode, it will incrementally render only pages that have changed. Unfortunately,only the rendered pages will be captured in the cross-reference tables. So you should ignore how the tables look while editing in preview, then run `quarto render` twice to get the information restored.

## Project configuration

In the `_quarto.yml` file you need to include something like the following:

```markdown
project:
  type: book
  pre-render: clean.ts
  post-render: concatenate.ts

filters:
  - crossref-listings

crossref_listings:
  - exm
  - def
```

The `post-render` script is required, as is the `filters` value. The `crossref_listings` entry is a list of [theorem-like prefixes](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html#theorems-and-proofs) to be collected.

## Custom fields

When you create a theorem-like div, you can give it extra attributes that Quarto ignores. These can then be referenced as columns in your listings table.

::::{#exm-usage-fields description="Custom fields" type=actual}
@exm-example1 was created with the following code:

```markdown
::::{#exm-example1 description="A fine example" type=foo}
## Good example
This is example 1.

## Creating cross-reference listings

The tables of cross references  are created using the (listing)[https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings.html] mechanism of Quarto websites. All this extension does is to collect the relevant information in files in the `_crossrefs` subdirectory. You just include the one you want in the `contents` metadata of `listing`.

::::{#exm-usage-create description="Creating a listing" type=actual}
To create the definition table below, the following was put into the metadata of this file:

```markdown
listing:
  - id: Definitions
    contents: 
      - _crossrefs/def.yml
      - _crossrefs
    type: table
    fields: [title, link]
```
Then, at the place where the table is to appear, we put 
```markdown
:::{#Definitions}
:::
```
:::{#Definitions}
:::
::::

::: {.callout-important}
The inclusion of `_crossrefs` in the `contents` property above seems superfluous, but the Quarto listing mechanism seems to ignore a file of listing info unless it also has a directory to scan.
:::

## Customizing the appearance

The cross-reference tables are created using the [listings](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings.html) mechanism of Quarto websites and can be extensively customized in exactly the same way.

::::{#exm-other description="On another page" type=foo}
Another pointless non-example.
